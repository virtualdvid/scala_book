    "## Functions and Closures\n",
    "\n",
    "When programs get larger, you need some way to divide them into smaller, more manageable pieces. For dividing up control flow, Scala offers an approach familiar to all experienced programmers: divide the code into functions. In fact, Scala offers several ways to define functions that are not present in Java. Besides methods, which are functions that are members of some object, there are also functions nested within functions, function literals, and function values. This chapter takes you on a tour t through all of these flavors of functions in Scala.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8.1 METHODS\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common way to define a function is as a member of some object; such a function is called a method. As an example, Listing 8.1 shows two methods that together read a file with a given name and print out all lines whose length exceeds a given width. Every printed line is prefixed with the name of the file it appears in."

The `for` expression processes each of these lines by calling the helper method, `processLine`. The `processLine` method takes three parameters: a `filename`, a `width`, and a `line`.

In the interpreter this is not so much of a problem, but once functions are packaged in reusable classes and objects, it's desirable to hide the helper functions from clients of a class. They often do not make sense individually, and you often want to keep enough flexibility to delete the helper functions if you later rewrite the class a different way.\n",

When you apply this function value to some arguments, it in turn applies `sum` to those same arguments and returns the result.

    "Scala's syntax for partially applied functions highlights a difference in the design trade-offs of Scala and classical functional languages, such as Haskell or ML. In these languages, partially applied functions are considered the normal case. Furthermore, these languages have a fairly strict static type system that will usually highlight every error with partial applications that you can make. Scala bears a much closer relation to imperative languages, such as Java, where a method that's not applied to all its arguments is considered an error. Furthermore, the object-oriented tradition of subtyping and a universal root type accepts some programs that would be considered erroneous in classical functional languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, say you mistook the `drop(n: Int)` method of `List` for `tail()`, and therefore forgot you need to pass a number to drop. You might write, `println(drop)`. Had Scala adopted the classical functional tradition that partially applied functions are OK everywhere, this code would type check. However, you might be surprised to find out that the output printed by this `println` statement would always be `<function>`! What would have happened is that the expression drop would have been treated as a function object. Because `println` takes objects of any type, this would have compiled OK, but it would\n",

    "## 8.10 CONCLUSION\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter has given you a grand tour of functions in Scala. In addition to methods, Scala provides local functions, function literals, and function values. In addition to normal function calls, Scala provides partially applied functions and functions with repeated parameters. When possible, function calls are implemented as optimized tail calls, and thus many nice-looking recursive functions run just as quickly as hand-optimized versions that use `while` loops. The next chapter will build on these foundations and show how Scala's rich support for functions helps you abstract over control.\n",

    "[1] In this book, we usually won't check command-line arguments for validity in example applications, both to save trees and reduce boilerplate code that can obscure the example's important code. The trade-off is that instead of producing a helpful error message when given bad input, our example applications will throw an exception.  \n",
    "[2] Every function value is an instance of some class that extends one of several FunctionNtraits in package scala, such as Function0 for functions with no parameters, Function1 for functions with one parameter, and so on. Each FunctionN trait has an apply method used to invoke the function.  \n",
    "[3] A foreach method is defined in trait Traversable, a common supertrait of List, Set, Array, andMap. See Chapter 17 for the details.  \n",
    "[4] The generated class extends trait Function3, which declares a three-arg apply method.  \n",
    "[5] By contrast, Java's inner classes do not allow you to access modifiable variables in surrounding scopes at all, so there is no difference between capturing a variable and capturing its currently held\n",
