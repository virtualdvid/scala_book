    "[1] This to method actually returns not an array but a different kind of sequence, containing the values 0, 1, and 2, which the for expression iterates over. Sequences and other collections will be described in Chapter 17.  \n",
    "[2] Variable-length argument lists, or repeated parameters, are described in Section 8.8.  \n",
    "[3] You don't need to say new List because \"List.apply()\" is defined as a factory method on the scala.List companion object. You'll read more on companion objects in Section 4.3.  \n",
    "[4] The reason you need Nil at the end is that :: is defined on class List. If you try to just say1 :: 2 :: 3, it won't compile because 3 is an Int, which doesn't have a :: method.  \n",
    "[5] Although conceptually you could create tuples of any length, currently the Scala library only defines them up to Tuple22.  \n",
    "[6] Because the set in Listing 3.6 is mutable, there is no need to reassign movieSet, which is why it can be a val. By contrast, using += with the immutable set in Listing 3.5 required reassigning jetSet, which is why it must be a var.  \n",
    "[7] The explicit type parameterization, \"[Int, String]\", is required in Listing 3.7 because without any values passed to the factory method, the compiler is unable to infer the map's type parameters. By contrast, the compiler can infer the type parameters from the values passed to the map factory shown in Listing 3.8, thus no explicit type parameters are needed.  \n",
    "[8] The Scala mechanism that allows you to invoke -> on any object, implicit conversion, will be covered in Chapter 21."
