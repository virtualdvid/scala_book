    "Now that you've seen classes and objects in action, it's a good time to look at Scala's basic types and operations in more depth. If you're familiar with Java, you'll be glad to find that Java's basic types and operators have the same meaning in Scala. However, there are some interesting differences that will make this chapter worth reading even if you're an experienced Java developer. Because some aspects of Scala covered in this chapter are essentially the same as in Java, we've inserted notes indicating what sections Java developers can safely skip.\n",

    "In this chapter, you'll get an overview of Scala's basic types, including `Strings` and the value types `Int`, `Long`, `Short`, `Byte`, `Float`, `Double`, `Char`, and `Boolean`. You'll learn the operations you can perform on these types, including how operator precedence works in Scala expressions. You'll also learn how implicit conversions can \"enrich\" variants of these basic types, giving you additional operations beyond those supported by Java."

    "| Basic | type Range |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| Byte | 8-bit signed two's complement integer (-27 to 27 - 1, inclusive) |\n",
    "| Short | 16-bit signed two's complement integer (-215 to 215 - 1, inclusive) |\n",
    "| Int | 32-bit signed two's complement integer (-231 to 231 - 1, inclusive) |\n",
    "| Long | 64-bit signed two's complement integer (-263 to 263 - 1, inclusive) |\n",

    "Other than `String`, which resides in package `java.lang`, all of the types shown in Table 5.1 are members of package scala.[1] For example, the full name of `Int` is `scala.Int`. However, given that all the members of package scala and `java.lang` are automatically imported into every Scala source file, you can just use the simple names (i.e., names like `Boolean`, `Char`, or `String`) everywhere. Savvy Java developers will note that Scala's basic types have the exact same ranges as the corresponding types in Java. This enables the Scala compiler to transform instances of Scalavalue types, such as `Int` or `Double`, down to Java primitive types in the bytecodes it produces."

    "Operator precedence determines which parts of an expression are evaluated before the other parts. For example, the expression `2 + 2 * 7` evaluates to `16`, not `28`, because the `*` operator has a higher precedence than the `+` operator. Thus the multiplication part of the expression is evaluated before the addition part. You can of course use parentheses in expressions to clarify evaluation order or to override precedence. For example, if you really wanted the result of the expression above to be 28, you could write the expression like this:\n",

If the method name starts with a `*`, for example, it will have a higher precedence than a method that starts with a `+`. Thus `2 + 2 * 7` will be evaluated as `2 + (2 * 7)`. Similarly, `a +++ b *** c` (in which `a`, `b`, and `c` are variables, and `+++` and `***` are methods) will be evaluated `a +++ (b *** c)`, because the `***` method has a higher precedence than the `+++` method.\n",

    "When multiple operators of the same precedence appear side by side in an expression, the associativity of the operators determines the way operators are grouped. The associativity of an operator in Scala is determined by its last character. As mentioned here of Chapter 3, any method that ends in a `:'` character is invoked on its right operand, passing in the left operand. Methods that end in any other character are the other way around: They are invoked on their left operand, passing in the right operand. So `a * b` yields `a.*(b)`, but `a ::: b` yields `b.:::(a)`.\n",

    "This associativity rule also plays a role when multiple operators of the same precedence appear side by side. If the methods end in `:'`, they are grouped right to left; otherwise, they are grouped left to right. For example, `a ::: b ::: c` is treated as `a ::: (b ::: c)`. But `a * b * c`, by contrast, is treated as `(a * b) * c`.\n",

    "Operator precedence is part of the Scala language. You needn't be afraid to use it. Nevertheless, it is good style to use parentheses to clarify what operators are operating upon what expressions. Perhaps the only precedence you can truly count on other programmers knowing without looking up is that multiplicative operators, `*`, `/`, and `%`, have a higher precedence than the additive ones `+` and `-`. Thus even if `a + b << c` yields the result you want without parentheses, the extra clarity you get by writing `(a + b) << c` may reduce the frequency with which your peers utter your name in operator notation, for example, by shouting in disgust, `\"bills !*&^%~ code!\"`.[8]"
