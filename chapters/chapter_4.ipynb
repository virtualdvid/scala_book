    "\"`if (cache.contains(s))`\", checks the cache to see if the passed string is already contained as a key in the map. If so, it just returns the mapped value, cache(s). Otherwise, it executes the else clause, which calculates the checksum. The first line of the else clause defines a val named `acc` and initializes it with a new `ChecksumAccumulator` instance.[3] The next line is a for expression, which cycles through each character in the passed string, converts the character to a Byte by invoking `toByte` on it, and passes that to the `add` method of the `ChecksumAccumulator` instances to which `acc` refers. After the for expression completes, the next line of the method invokes `checksum` on `acc`, which gets the `checksum` for the passed String, and stores it into a val named `cs`. In the next line, `cache += (s -> cs)`, the passed string key is mapped to the integer `checksum` value, and this key-value pair is added to the cache map. The last expression of the method, `cs`, ensures the `checksum` is the result of the method.\n",

Using fsc, you only need to wait for the Java runtime to startup the first time. If you ever want to stop the fsc daemon, you can do so with `fsc` -shutdown.\n",

In general, you would likely use such a cache only if you encountered a performance problem that the cache solves, and might use a weak map, such as WeakHashMap in scala.collection.jcl, so that entries in the cache could be garbage collected if memory becomes scarce.  \n",
