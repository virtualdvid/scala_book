    "## Composition and Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Chapter 6 introduced some basic object-oriented aspects of Scala. This chapter picks up where Chapter 6 left off and dives into Scala's support for object-oriented programming in much greater detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll compare two fundamental relationships between classes: composition and inheritance. Composition means one class holds a reference to another, using the referenced class to help it fulfill its mission. Inheritance is the superclass/subclass relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to these topics, we'll discuss abstract classes, parameterless methods, extending classes,\n",
    "overriding methods and fields, parametric fields, invoking superclass constructors, polymorphism and dynamic binding, final members and classes, and factory objects and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10.1 A TWO-DIMENSIONAL LAYOUT LIBRARY\n",
    "\n",
    "As a running example in this chapter, we'll create a library for building and rendering two-dimensional layout elements. Each element will represent a rectangle filled with text. For convenience, the library will provide factory methods named \"elem\" that construct new elements from passed data. For example, you'll be able to create a layout element containing a string using a factory method with the following signature:\n",
    "\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "elem(s: String): Element\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, elements will be modeled with a type named `Element`. You'll be able to call above or beside on an element, passing in a second element, to get a new element that combines the two. For example, the following expression would construct a larger element consisting of two columns, each with a height of two:\n",
    "\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "val column1 = elem(\"hello\") above elem(\"***\")\n",
    "val column2 = elem(\"***\") above elem(\"world\")\n",
    "column1 beside column2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Printing the result of this expression would give you:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "hello ***\n",
    "*** world\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Layout elements are a good example of a system in which objects can be constructed from simple parts with the aid of composing operators. In this chapter, we'll define classes that enable element objects to be constructed from arrays, lines, and rectangles. These basic element objects will be the simple parts. We'll also define composing operators above and beside. Such composing operators are also often called combinators because they combine elements of some domain into new elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thinking in terms of combinators is generally a good way to approach library design: it pays to think\n",
    "about the fundamental ways to construct objects in an application domain. What are the simple objects? In what ways can more interesting objects be constructed out of simpler ones? How do combinators hang together? What are the most general combinations? Do they satisfy any interesting laws? If you have good answers to these questions, your library design is on track.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10.2 ABSTRACT CLASSES\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first task is to define type Element, which represents layout elements. Since elements are two dimensional rectangles of characters, it makes sense to include a member, contents, that refers to the contents of a layout element. The contents can be represented as an array of strings, where each string represents a line. Hence, the type of the result returned by contents will be Array[String].

    "The two pairs of definitions are completely equivalent from a client's point of view. The only difference is that field accesses might be slightly faster than method invocations because the field values are precomputed when the class is initialized, instead of being computed on each method call. On the other hand, the fields require extra memory space in each `Element` object. So it depends on the usage profile of a class whether an attribute is better represented as a field or method, and that usage profile might change over time. The point is that clients of the `Element` class should not be affected when its internal implementation changes.\n",

Some other array methods will be explained in this chapter and a more comprehensive discussion will be given in Chapter 17.\n",

To keep things simple in this section, however, we'll leave this as is and only pass elements of the same length to above. In Section 10.14, we'll make an enhancement to above so that clients can use it to combine elements of different widths.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next method to implement is beside. To put two elements beside each other, we'll create a new element in which every line results from concatenating corresponding lines of the two elements. As before, to keep things simple, we'll start by assuming the two elements have the same height. This leads to the following design of method `beside`:\n",

    "\n",
    "The beside method first allocates a new array, contents, and fills it with the concatenation of the corresponding array elements in `this.contents` and `that.contents`. It finally produces a new `ArrayElement` containing the new contents. Although this implementation of `beside` works, it is in an imperative style, the telltale sign of which is the loop in which we index through arrays.

    "\n",
    "The zipped array is then iterated over by a `for` expression. Here, the syntax `for ((line1, line2) <- ...)` allows you to name both elements of a pair in one pattern (i.e., `line1` stands now for the first element of the pair, and `line2` stands for the second). Scala's pattern-matching system will be described in detail in Chapter 15. For now, you can just think of this as a way to define two vals, `line1` and `line2`, for each step of the iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "The for expression has a `yield` part and therefore yields a result. The result is of the same kind as the expression iterated over (i.e., it is an array). Each element of the array is the result of concatenating the corresponding lines, `line1` and `line2`. So the end result of this code is the same as in the first version of beside, but because it avoids explicit array indexing, the result is obtained in a less error-prone way.\n",
    "\n",

The result contains the contents of this `Element`, centered, padded to the left and right by any spaces needed to achieve the required width. Listing 10.13 also shows a similar method, `heighten`, which performs the same function in the vertical direction. The `widen` method is invoked by above to ensure that `Elements` placed above each other have the same `width`. Similarly, the `heighten` method is invoked by beside to ensure that elements placed beside each other have the same `height`. With these changes, the layout library is ready for use."

    "## 10.16 CONCLUSION\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you saw more concepts related to object-oriented programming in Scala. Among others, you encountered abstract classes, inheritance and subtyping, class hierarchies, parametric fields, and method overriding. You should have developed a feel for constructing a non-trivial class hierarchy in Scala. We'll work with the layout library again inChapter 14.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Footnotes for Chapter 10:\n",
    "\n",
    "[1] Meyer, Object-Oriented Software Construction [Mey00]  \n",
    "[2] One flaw with this design is that because the returned array is mutable, clients could change it. For the book we'll keep things simple, but were ArrayElement part of a real project, you might consider returning a defensive copy of the array instead. Another problem is we aren't currently ensuring that every String element of the contents array has the same length. This could be solved by checking the precondition in the primary constructor and throwing an exception if it is violated.  \n",
    "[3] For more perspective on the difference between subclass and subtype, see the glossary entry for subtype.  \n",
    "[4] The reason that packages share the same name space as fields and methods in Scala is to enable you to import packages (in addition to just the names of types) and the fields and methods of singleton objects. This is also something you can't do in Java. It will be described in Section 13.3.  \n",
    "[5] The protected modifier, which grants access to subclasses, will be covered in detail inChapter 13.  \n",
    "[6] In Java 1.5, an @Override annotation was introduced that works similarly to Scala's overridemodifier, but unlike Scala's override, is not required.  \n",
    "[7] This kind of polymorphism is called subtyping polymorphism. Another kind of polymorphism in Scala called universal polymorphism is discussed in Chapter 19.  \n",
    "[8] Meyers, Effective C++ [Mey91]  \n",
    "[9] Eckel, Thinking in Java [Eck98]  \n",
    "[10] Class ArrayElement also has a composition relationship with Array, because its parametriccontents field holds a reference to an array of strings. The code for ArrayElement is shown in Listing 10.5 here. Its composition relationship is represented in class diagrams by a diamond, as shown, for example, in Figure 10.1 here."
