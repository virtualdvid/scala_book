    "res0: Int = 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This line includes:\n",

    "• an automatically generated or user-defined name to refer to the computed value (res0, which\n",

    "• an equals sign (=),  \n",

    "A var can be reassigned throughout its lifetime. Here's a val definition:\n",

    "scala> val msg = \"Hello, world!\"\n",
    "msg: String = Hello, world!\n",
    "```\n",

    "of `msg` is `java.lang.String`, because Scala strings are implemented by Java's String class.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're used to declaring variables in Java, you'll notice one striking difference here:\n",
    "\n",
    "`neitherjava.lang.String` nor String appear anywhere in the val definition. This example illustrates type\n",
    "inference, Scala's ability to figure out types you leave off. In this case, because you initialized `msg` with\n",
    "a string literal, Scala inferred the type of `msg` to be String. When the Scala interpreter (or compiler) can\n",
    "infer types, it is often best to let it do so rather than fill the code with unnecessary, explicit type\n",
    "annotations. You can, however, specify a type explicitly if you wish, and sometimes you probably\n",
    "should. An explicit type annotation can both ensure the Scala compiler infers the type you intend, as\n",
    "well as serve as useful documentation for future readers of the code. In contrast to Java, where you\n",
    "specify a variable's type before its name, in Scala you specify a variable's type after its name, separated\n",
    "by a colon. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "scala> val msg3: String = \"Hello yet again, world!\"\n",
    "msg3: String = Hello yet again, world!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Going back to the original `msg`, now that it is defined, you can use it as you'd expect, for example:\n",

    "```\n",
    "scala> println(msg)\n",
    "Hello, world!\n",
    "```\n",

    "[4] The simple name of java.lang.String is String.  \n",
    "[5] In the interpreter, however, you can define a new val with a name that was already used before. This\n",
    "mechanism is explained in Section 7.7.  \n",
    "[6] In Java, the type of the value returned from a method is its return type. In Scala, that same concept\n",
    "is called result type.  \n",
    "[7] A function is recursive if it calls itself.  \n",
    "[8] Nevertheless, it is often a good idea to indicate function result types explicitly, even when the\n",
    "compiler doesn't require it. Such type annotations can make the code easier to read, because the reader\n",
    "need not study the function body to figure out the inferred result type.  \n",
    "[9] You can run scripts without typing \"scala\" on Unix and Windows using a \"pound-bang\" syntax,\n",
    "which is shown in Appendix A.  \n",
    "[10] This shorthand, called a partially applied function, is described in Section 8.6.  \n",
    "[11] You can say \"in\" for the <- symbol. You'd read for (arg <- args), therefore, as \"for arg in args.\""
