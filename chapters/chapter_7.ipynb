    "## Built-in Control Structures"

  },

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Scala has only a handful of built-in control structures. The only control structures are `if`, `while`, `for`, `try`, `match`, and function calls. The reason Scala has so few is that it has included function literals since its inception. Instead of accumulating one higher-level control structure after another in the base syntax, Scala accumulates them in libraries. (Chapter 9 will show precisely how that is done.) This chapter will show those few control structures that are built in.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing you will notice is that almost all of Scala's control structures result in some value. This is the approach taken by functional languages, where programs are viewed as computing a value, thus the components of a program should also compute values. You can also view this approach as the logical conclusion of a trend already present in imperative languages. In imperative languages, function calls can return a value, even though having the called function update an output variable passed as an argument would work just as well. In addition, imperative languages often have a ternary operator (such as the `?:` operator of C, C++, and Java), which behaves exactly like if, but results in a value. Scala adopts this ternary operator model, but calls it if. In other words, Scala's if can result in a value. Scala then continues this trend by having for, try, and match also result in values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programmers can use these result values to simplify their code, just as they use return values of functions. Without this facility, the programmer must create temporary variables just to hold results that are calculated inside a control structure. Removing these temporary variables makes the code a little simpler, and it also prevents many bugs where you set the variable in one branch but forget to set it in another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, Scala's basic control structures, minimal as they are, provide all of the essentials from imperative languages. Further, they allow you to shorten your code by consistently having result values. To show you how this works, we'll take a closer look at each of Scala's basic control structures."

    "Scala's `if` works just like in many other languages. It tests a condition and then executes one of two code branches depending on whether the condition holds true. Here is a common example, written in an imperative style:\n",
    "\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "var filename = \"default.txt\"\n",
    "if (!args.isEmpty)\n",
    "    filename = args(0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code declares a variable, filename, and initializes it to a default value. It then uses an `if` expression to check whether any arguments were supplied to the program. If so, it changes the variable to hold the value specified in the argument list. If no arguments were supplied, it leaves the variable set to the default value.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code can be written more nicely because, as mentioned in Step 3 in Chapter 2, Scala's if is an expression that results in a value. Listing 7.1 shows how you can accomplish the same effect as the previous example, without using any vars:\n",
    "\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "val filename =\n",
    "if (!args.isEmpty) args(0)\n",
    "else \"default.txt\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "Listing 7.1 - Scala's idiom for conditional initialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "This time, the `if` has two branches. If args is not empty, the initial element, args(0), is chosen; otherwise, the default value is chosen. The if expression results in the chosen value, and the `filename` variable is initialized with that value. This code is slightly shorter, but its real advantage is that it uses a `val` instead of a `var`. Using a `val` is the functional style, and it helps you in much the same way as a final variable in Java. It tells readers of the code that the variable will never change, saving them from scanning all code in the variable's scope to see if it ever changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "A second advantage to using a `val` instead of a `var` is that it better supports equational reasoning. The introduced variable is equal to the expression that computes it, assuming that expression has no side effects. Thus, any time you are about to write the variable name, you could instead write the expression. Instead of `println(filename)`, for example, you could just write this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "println(if (!args.isEmpty) args(0) else \"default.txt\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice is yours. You can write it either way. Using vals helps you safely make this kind of refactoring as your code evolves over time. Look for opportunities to use vals. They can make your code both easier to read and easier to refactor."

In the previous example, each alternative in the match expression prints out a value. It would work just as well to yield the value rather than print it, as shown in Listing 7.15. The value that results from this match expression is stored in the friend variable. Aside from the code getting shorter (in number of tokens anyway), the code now disentangles two separate concerns: first it chooses a food and then prints it."

    "The imperative style reveals itself in Listing 7.18 in two ways. First, invoking `printMultiTable` has a side effect: printing a multiplication table to the standard output. In Listing 7.19, we refactored the function so that it returns the multiplication table as a string. Since the function no longer prints, we renamed it `multiTable`. As mentioned previously, one advantage of side-effect-free functions is they are easier to unit test. To test `printMultiTable`, you would need to somehow redefine `print` and `println` so you could check the output for correctness. You could test multiTable more easily by checking its string result.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other telltale sign of the imperative style in `printMultiTable` is its `while` loop and `vars`. By contrast, the multiTable function uses `vals`, for expressions, helper functions, and calls to `mkString`. We factored out the two helper functions, `makeRow` and `makeRowSeq`, to make the code easier to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "Function `makeRowSeq` uses a for expression whose generator iterates through column numbers `1` through `10`. The body of this for calculates the product of row and column, determines the padding needed for the product, and yields the result of concatenating the padding and product strings. The result of the for expression will be a sequence (some subclass of `scala.Seq`) containing these yielded strings as elements. The other helper function, `makeRow`, simply invokes `mkString` on the result returned by `makeRowSeq`. `mkString` will concatenate the strings in the sequence and return them as one string.\n",
    "\n",
    "The multiTable method first initializes `tableSeq` with the result of a for expression whose generator iterates through row numbers 1 to 10, and for each calls `makeRow` to get the string for that row. This string is yielded; thus the result of this for expression will be a sequence of row strings. The only remaining task is to convert the sequence of strings into a single string. The call to `mkString` accomplishes this, and because we pass `\"\\n\"`, we get an end of line character inserted between each string. If you pass the string returned by multiTable to `println`, you'll see the same output that's produced by calling `printMultiTable`.\n",

    "Scala's built-in control structures are minimal, but they do the job. They act much like their imperative equivalents, but because they tend to result in a value, they support a functional style, too. Just as important, they are careful in what they omit, thus leaving room for one of Scala's most powerful features, the function literal, which will be described in the next chapter.\n",

    "[1] The gcd function shown in Listing 7.4 uses the same approach used by the like-named function, first shown in Listing 6.3, to calculate greatest common divisors for class Rational. The main difference is that instead of Ints the gcd of Listing 7.4 works with Longs.  \n",
    "[2] To be precise, the expression to the right of the <- symbol in a for expression can be any type that has certain methods (in this case foreach) with appropriate signatures. Details on how the Scala compiler processes for expressions are described in Chapter 23.  \n",
    "[3] Although you must always surround the case statements of a catch clause in parentheses,try and finally do not require parentheses if they contain only one expression. For example, you could write: try t() catch { case e: Exception => ... } finally f().  \n",
    "[4] There are a few exceptions to this rule because in Scala you can sometimes use curly braces in place of parentheses. One example of this kind of curly-brace use is the alternativefor expression syntax described in Section 7.3.  \n",
    "[5] The printMultiTable function shown in Listing 7.18 is written in an imperative style. We'll refactor it into a functional style in the next section.  \n",
