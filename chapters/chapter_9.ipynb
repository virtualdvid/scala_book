When you use a function value as an argument, the non-common part of the algorithm is itself some other algorithm! At each invocation of such a function, you can pass in a different function value as an argument, and the invoked function will, at times of its choosing, invoke the passed function value.\n",

    "These higher-order functions—functions that take functions as parameters— give you extra opportunities to condense and simplify code. One benefit of higher-order functions is they enable you to create control abstractions that allow you to reduce code duplication. For example, suppose you are writing a file browser, and you want to provide an API that allows users to search for files matching some criterion. First, you add a facility to search for files whose names end in a particular string. This would enable your users to find, for example, all files with a `.scala` extension. You could provide such an API by defining a public `filesEnding` method inside a singleton object like this:"

Earlier in the chapter you saw `filesMatching`, a very specialized control pattern. Consider now a more widely used coding pattern: open a resource, operate\n",

This technique is called the loan pattern, because a control-abstraction function, such as `withPrintWriter`, opens a resource and `loans` it to a function. For instance, with `PrintWriter` in the previous example loans a `PrintWriter` to the function, `op`.\n",

    "## 9.6 CONCLUSION\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter has shown you how to build on Scala's rich function support to build control abstractions.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use functions within your code to factor out common control patterns, and you can take advantage of higher-order functions in the Scala library to reuse control patterns that are common across all programmers' code. We also discussed how to use currying and by-name parameters so that your own higher-order functions can be used with a concise syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous chapter and this one, you have seen quite a lot of information about functions. The next few chapters will go back to discussing more object-oriented features of the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Footnotes for Chapter 9:\n",
    "\n",
    "[1] These special-purpose looping methods are defined in trait Traversable, which is extended by List, Set, and Map. See Chapter 17 for a discussion.  \n",
    "[2] In the previous chapter, when the placeholder notation was used on traditional methods, like `println _`, you had to leave a space between the name and the underscore. In this case you don't, because whereas `println_` is a legal identifier in Scala, `curriedSum(1)_` is not.  \n",
    "[3] You'll call this `myAssert`, not assert, because Scala provides an assert of its own, which will be described in Section 14.1."
