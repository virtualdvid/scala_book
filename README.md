# Programming in SCALA

work in progress...

I just want to learn `scala`. I found this book [Programming in Scala: A Comprehensive Step-by-Step Guide, Third Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Scala-Comprehensive-Step-Step-ebook/dp/B01EX49FOU) and wanted to start some `jupyter notebooks` and play with the code to see in action what's `scala` about. This repository is just copy and paste from the book. Nothing is coming from me, all credits to the book authors. Please support them buying their book.

If you want to run the notebooks do:

 - get [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
 - create an environment: `conda create -n scala python=3.7`
 - activate environment: `conda activate scala`
 - install jupyter notebooks: `pip install jupyter`
 - install [spylon-kernel](https://github.com/Valassis-Digital-Media/spylon-kernel)
 - Have fun!
